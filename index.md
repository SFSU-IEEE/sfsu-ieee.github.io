#Hello World!
This is the official site for IEEE students at SFSU. You will find all information regarding our student chapter here on this site. We have meetings once every two weeks and our goal is to continue the learning of electrical and electronic engineering outside the classroom.

###Last meeting:
Last meeting we had Wendy Al-Mukdad come to present. The presentation was great with all the advice and help she provided for us as students. We also had a few members of SWE come and attend our meeting. If you need any information on the scholarship or internship oppertunity Wendy spoke about ask Jose or any of the other officers. 

Friday was also the last day to pay student dues. Shirts prices as a result went up to $20.00. We expect to have the shirts ready to hand out the week we come back to school.
####Brain Teasers:
Problem #1:
You have a fox, a chicken and a sack of grain. You must cross a river with only one of them at a time. If you leave the fox with the chicken he will eat it; if you leave the chicken with the grain he will eat it. How can you get all three across safely?

Problem #2:
How can you make four identical, equilateral triangles from six matchstickes? Hint: you might have to think differently than you normally would.

Probelm #3:
Consider the circle below with the dot at the center. Starting from the center dot, how can you draw this circle without lifting your pen from the paper?
