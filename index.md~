This is the official site for IEEE students at SFSU. You will find all information regarding our student chapter here on this site. We have meetings once every two weeks and our goal is to continue the learning of electrical and electronic engineering outside the classroom.

###Last meeting:
Last meeting (April 17th) we talked and discussed a number of different things. The end of the year is coming to an end and it will be our first year of completion as an organization. To celebrate we will have an end of the year BBQ. We set the date to be May 10th (two weekends before finals) somewhere around Harding park (across the street). This will be a nice way to end the year and congratulate all of us on our hard work. If you would like to help set up the event please let Jose E. or Stephanie B. know. 

We will also hold elections for next year's officers. Nominations are going on now. You may email Jose E. or send an email to IEEE at SFSU. Each nominee will need to give a short 2-4 min speech on why they feel they would be good for said position. The day for the presentations to take place is May 8th. The results will be said during the BBQ. Voting will be held online and will be open for 24 hours. A list of nominees will be posted by May 1st. 

The coming week we are to host Jim Phillips for an early morning presentation in the cesar chavez building (please refer to the calendar for more information). We will also host a microcontroller workshop on April 23rd (Wednesday) with ASME (more info on calendar).
