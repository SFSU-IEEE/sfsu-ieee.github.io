This is the official site for IEEE students at SFSU. You will find all information regarding our student chapter here on this site. We have meetings once every two weeks and our goal is to continue the learning of electrical and electronic engineering outside the classroom.

###Last meeting:
Last meeting (April 4th) we gave a quick update on a few upcoming events and also handed out the t-shirts that everyone order. Talk to Jose E. or Stephanie R. if you need to pick yours up still or want to purchase one. 

There is just a few things to note. We will be having a presenter come on April 22nd. It will be an early morning presentation (@10am) and coffee/juice/pastries will be provided. Please be sure to bring a friend and sit in on a really good talk. We also discussed some exciting presentations for next semester. We plan to host a few SFSU alumni for a presentation on their experiences after college. There will also be one more presentation held by one of the electrical engineers that had a part in the design of the new Levi's stadium in Santa Clara.

There will be a collaboration event with the student chapter ASME on April 16th. The event is an introduction to microcontrollers (mostly focusing on Arduino). Still working on the details but it should all be sorted out by next week sometime. 

There was also a call for students to begin thinking of projects to submit to our web page. We would like to begin archiving all the work we as students do here at the university. Be sure to send us an email if you would like to submit anything to our project page. We also appreciate any ideas for the Course resources page. 
Again, if anyone wants to help in the design of this web page please email us as we need all the help we can get!
